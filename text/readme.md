**Text functions**
While Stata is not as good as R or Python for many textual analysis techniques, it is also not as bad as commonly assumed. 
In this folder I will put ado files for text analysis that I have created. 

Comments and suggestions are always welcome. For the most part, I wrote these commands for specific tasks so there is room for improvement.
