There are a number of different country classification used for data which sometimes makes merging different datasets difficult. I have written an ado file that translates between a few of the different coding schemes: Correlates of War, IMF, World Bank, Banks, and country names. 
The syntax is: ccode , from(database) to(database) gen(). The names of the databases are COW, IMF, WB, Banks, and cty.
